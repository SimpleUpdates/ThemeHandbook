# Components

## Layers

Components are grouped into three distinct layers:

- **Atoms:** "The foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements 
like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional."
- **Molecules:** "Relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search 
input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule."
- **Organisms:** "Relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These 
organisms form distinct sections of an interface."

(Definitions taken from *Atomic Design*, by Brad Frost, [chapter 2](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).)

## Benefits

Breaking themes into components several benefits:

- It becomes clear where to look to find all the Less or Twig source related to any given component.
- Components become more portable, as using a component architecture forces a clear separation between the source code of one
component and another, and allowing any given component to be used in many contexts.
- This clear separation between components makes modifying a single component easier, as it allows for the assumption that the
source of one component will not affect any other component outside its context.
- Breaking a theme into components keeps its layout files and `global.less` file short, making them easier to understand and
modify.
- Because they are context agnostic, components can be displayed in a styleguide for easier and more-flexible testing.
- Components help with keeping things DRY ([Don't Repeat Yourself](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don%27t_Repeat_Yourself)) by eliminating code duplication, thereby increasing theme
maintainability.

## File Structure

Each component has a name in the form of `.layer-componentIdentifier`. (For more information on naming components, see 
[naming_things.md](https://github.com/SimpleUpdates/ThemeHandbook/blob/master/naming_things.md).) This name is used for a 
component's Twig partial, Less file, and base CSS classname.

All component Twig partials are placed in the theme's `partial/` folder. All component Less files are placed in the theme's
`style/` folder, and included at the end of `global.less`, grouped by layer, within `.su_bootstrap_safe`, if the theme uses it.

```Less
// Variable declarations ...

.su_bootstrap_safe
  // Global CSS ...

  @import "styleguide";

  @import "atom-button";
  @import "atom-search";

  @import "molecule-branding";
  @import "molecule-breadcrumbs";
  @import "molecule-carousel";
  @import "molecule-nav";
  @import "molecule-icons";

  @import "organism-footer";
  @import "organism-navBar";

  @import "custom";
}
```

Note that, even though each component Less file filename should end with `.less`, it's not necessary to include the 
extension when importing the file in `global.less`.

## Smells

"A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system" ([Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html)).

If you notice any of the following in a theme, it's likely that the theme hasn't been broken into components properly.

- **A component's Less file contains CSS that's only relevant in a specific context.** A component's Less file should only
contain CSS that would be relevant to it no matter where in a theme it's used. Whenever you see CSS in a component's Less file
that relates to its use in an ancestor component, that CSS should be moved into its ancestor's Less file.
- **A component's Less file or Twig file is not wrapped with its primary class.** In order to keep components as portable as
possible, it's useful to apply the component's primary class name (in the form of `.layer-componentIdentifier`) to its 
outermost element, and to wrap everything in its Less file, including variable declarations, with the same class. This practice
increases the confidence we can have that a given component's CSS will only ever affect its intended component.
- **A component's CSS references variables not declared in the same file.** Generally, by redeclaring any needed global variables within the component's primary class scope, and only using those redeclared variables in the component's CSS, the component is made more portable and easier to customize. (For more information on naming these redelcared variables, see [naming_things.md](https://github.com/SimpleUpdates/ThemeHandbook/blob/master/naming_things.md).) One exception to this rule is global breakpoint variables (e.g. `@screenSmMax`), which should be referenced without being redeclared. 
- **A component's Twig source doesn't make sense alone.** If you see an orphaned `</div>` at the beginning of a component's Twig file, or an unclosed element at its end, that's a strong indication that the component hasn't been properly decoupled
from other components or templates, and needs to be refactored so it can stand alone.
- **Component-specific media queries appear in `global.less`.** Any media queries that relate to a given component regardless of its context should be kept in that component's Less file.
- **Print-specific CSS rules appear inside a component's Less file.** The one exception to the previous smell is print media queries, which should only appear in `global.less`; or, preferrably, a separate `print.less` file.
