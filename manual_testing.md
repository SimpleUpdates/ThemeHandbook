## Testing in Multiple Browsers Using Browsersync

[Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) allows you to sync scrolling, clicking, live reloading, etc, between multiple windows and browsers. It makes testing multiple screen widths and browsers much simpler.

To use Browsersync, after installing, navigate to `SUFramework/cache/` in Terminal and run the following command:

```
browser-sync start --proxy "localhost:8080" --files "css/**/*.css" "twig/**/*.php"
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in as many browsers, windows, or devices on the same network as you wish to test in.
