> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things" (Phil Karlton, [via Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)).

Good names are important, because code is only easy to change when it's easy to read and understand.

## General

- Prioritize understandable over short names.
- Avoid abbreviations and otherwise-unpronouncable names.
- If something is a collection of other things, name it as the plural of what it contains.
- If something is a single thing, give it a singular noun name.
- If something is a function, give it a verb name.
- Aim for names that allow your code to read like well-formed prose.

## Naming Less Variables

Less variable names should be camel cased.

| Yes             | No
|-----------------|-----------------
| `@variableName` | `@VariableName`
|                 | `@variable_name`
|                 | `@variable-name`

Less variable names depend on context.

Less variables that hold user-provided values should mirror the name of the config property.

| Yes                                 | No
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------
| `@accentColor: @config-accentColor` | `@mainColor: @config-accentColor`

All other Less variables defined in `global.less` should reflect their content, not their intended use.

| Yes             | No
|-----------------|------------------------
| `@greyLight`    | `@borderColor`
| `@accentMedium` | `@linkColor`
| `@tan`          | `@carouselButtonColor`

Less variables defined in components, on the other hand, should be named in reference to their use, and not their content.

| Yes                          | No
|------------------------------|---------------------------
| `@linkColor: @accentDark`    | `@buttonGrey: @greyMedium`

## Naming CSS Classes

Most CSS class names should be hyphenated. The exceptions to this rule are classes related to a specific component. A
component's basename should take the form of `.layer-componentName` in order to mirror the component's file name. Its
internal classes should be of the form `.layer-componentName__subclass`.

| Yes                               | No
|-----------------------------------|-----------------
| `.class-name`                     | `@className`
| `.organism-navBar`                | `@class_name`
| `.molecule-contentHeader__byline` | `@ClassName`

## Naming Components

Components are grouped into three distinct layers:

- **Atoms:** "The foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements like 
form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional."
- **Molecules:** "Relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, 
and button can join together to create a search form molecule."
- **Organisms:** "Relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These 
organisms form distinct sections of an interface."

(Definitions taken from *Atomic Design*, by Brad Frost, [chapter 2](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).)

A component's name takes the form of its layer, followed by a hyphin, followed by its specific name in camel case:

| Yes                 | No
|---------------------|-----------------
| `atom-button`       | `atom-Button`
| `molecule-branding` | `branding`
| `organism-navBar`   | `org-nav-bar`

A component's name is used in three primary places: its Twig partial filename, its Less file filename, and its primary CSS
class. All three should be identical.

| Yes                                                                | No
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------
| `organism-navBar.html`, `organism-navBar.less`, `.organism-navBar` | `organism-NavBar.html`, `navBar.less`, `.org-nav-bar`
