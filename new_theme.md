## Creating Theme Thumbnails

The following steps should be taken on a retina screen to ensure the finished thumbnail is retina-ready.

0. Install [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/).
0. Activate the theme for which you wish to create thumbnails.
0. Open your test site's homepage in Firefox Developer Edition.
0. If you're logged in, add `/?_bare` to the end of the url to remove the admin toolbar.
0. Open Responsive Design Mode (cmd + opt + m).
0. Above the responsive page frame, enter the page dimensions for your screenshot (for mobile, 320x576; for desktop, 1280x800).
0. On the right of the control bar above your page dimensions, click the camera icon.
0. Open your Downloads folder and observe the finished thumbnail, and that its dimensions are twice that of 
   those you entered because it's a retina image.
